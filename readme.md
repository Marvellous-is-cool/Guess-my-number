**[HOW TO PLAY]
 There are two boards shared by you and the computer. Yours is on the right side while the computer's is on the left side. The computer will say a word in each board, and you also have to say the same word in each board. 

<br />
Enter two random numbers (e.g 1 and 2), each number for each board, which will randomly be converted to any of these three words ---- love, you and ever.
If any of the words in each board matches the one with the computer, you win and so gets a trophy. Win the both boards to earn two TROPHIES!
